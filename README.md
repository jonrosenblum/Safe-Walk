<h1 align="center"><b>Safe Walk</b></h1>
<h4 align="center">Going home can be a tough situation for people walking alone at night. We want to implement an interactive map where people can find a safe way home avoiding corners where crimes are likely to happen. This project leverages the Google Maps API and the CrimeoMeter API to display a heat map of recent assault and robbery locations within 10 miles of the users position. This visual element is bolstered with directions to a desired destination input by the user.</h4>
