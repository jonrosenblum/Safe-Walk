Safe Walk is an advanced web application meticulously crafted using the powerful MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) tech stack. This web-based solution prioritizes user safety, harnessing the capabilities of the Google Maps API and the Crimeometer API to offer a secure and reliable route planning experience for individuals traveling to their destination.

## Key Functionalities

By considering factors such as crime rates, time of day, and user preferences, it provides personalized route recommendations that prioritize safety.

2. **Emergency Contact Integration with Twilio**: Safety is paramount, and Safe Walk ensures peace of mind for users and their loved ones. The web application seamlessly integrates with Twilio, a leading communication platform, to notify designated emergency contacts if the user does not arrive at their destination within a predefined timeframe. This integration enables swift assistance in case of unforeseen circumstances.

3. **Real-time Location Tracking**: Safe Walk continually tracks the user's location in real-time, offering updates to their designated emergency contacts. Additionally, users can share their live location with friends or family, allowing them to monitor the journey in real-time.
